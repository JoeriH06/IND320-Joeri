    "\n",
    "- main takeaway from this project is that I was able to build on my prior knowledge and put it into practice. I already had some experience with Python, data analysis, and visualization, but this was the first time I had to bring all those skills together into a working Streamlit app. I learned how to apply methods I had previously only tested in notebooks in a more structured and user-facing context. That felt like a real step forward, because it showed me how data work can be packaged and shared in an interactive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working with Jupyter Notebook has become a day-to-day practice for me in the past couple of months. I use it frequently for assignments and experiments, and it was interesting to see how those skills carried over. In particular, I gained more confidence in formatting notebooks with Markdown and styles. For example, before this project I did not know that I could change the background color of Markdown boxes to make sections stand out visually. That might seem like a small detail, but it makes results easier to read and present, which is valuable for both myself and any audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working with Streamlit was not entirely new to me either, but making a whole app from scratch was quite fun. It gave me more insight into how to break down a problem: first designing the page structure, then adding components like tables and plots, and finally refining the user controls. Creating the plots and tables was especially interesting. I had to combine multiple new ideas: filtering the data by month, using selection sliders, and adding line charts to a table. None of these were things I had done before, so I had to research the documentation, watch tutorials, and experiment with different approaches. The final result was satisfying, and I feel I learned methods that I can reuse in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One specific challenge I faced was with dataset paths. Locally my code worked, but on Streamlit Cloud it failed. I asked ChatGPT about it and learned that Streamlit apps may run from a different working directory. The solution was to use the Path(__file__) variable to build absolute paths, and .parents[1] to walk up to the correct folder. This was a valuable lesson in environment differences and in making code more robust. Overall, the project was both challenging and rewarding, and I now feel more confident in combining notebooks with deployable apps.\n",
