Sometimes I get code errors that I don't understand, going to AI to explain the code errors for me helps me to fix the errors. Sometimes it gave me suggestions which I took, sometimes it gave me suggestions I did not like and then I looked up solutions on the web.  \n",

    "\n",
    "*Must include a 300-500-word log describing the compulsory work (including both Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit experience).*\n",
    "\n",
    "- main takeaway from this project is that I was able to build on my prior knowledge and put it into practice. I already had some experience with Python, data analysis, and visualization, but this was the first time I had to bring all those skills together into a working Streamlit app. I learned how to apply methods I had previously only tested in notebooks in a more structured and user-facing context. That felt like a real step forward, because it showed me how data work can be packaged and shared in an interactive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working with Jupyter Notebook has become a day-to-day practice for me in the past couple of months. I use it frequently for assignments and experiments, and it was interesting to see how those skills carried over. In particular, I gained more confidence in formatting notebooks with Markdown and styles. For example, before this project I did not know that I could change the background color of Markdown boxes to make sections stand out visually. That might seem like a small detail, but it makes results easier to read and present, which is valuable for both myself and any audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working with Streamlit was not entirely new to me either, but making a whole app from scratch was quite fun. It gave me more insight into how to break down a problem: first designing the page structure, then adding components like tables and plots, and finally refining the user controls. Creating the plots and tables was especially interesting. I had to combine multiple new ideas: filtering the data by month, using selection sliders, and adding line charts to a table. None of these were things I had done before, so I had to research the documentation, watch tutorials, and experiment with different approaches. The final result was satisfying, and I feel I learned methods that I can reuse in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One specific challenge I faced was with MongoDB. MongoDB is completely new for me and this took a while to get used to and connect. After I connected Mongo everything went way smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pipeline structure. The Medaillon pipeline structure was new for me, but this helped me structure my work way better. Splitting the retrieval of the data, cleaning and modeling in seperate files makes a way more clean working structure. After I found this out I switched most of my work to this structure which helped me to make my work faster and better.\n",

    "### **Waiting time enhancements (Spinners & Caching)**\n",
    "To improve the responsiveness of the app, I added spinners (`st.spinner`) to all time-consuming operations:  \n",
    "- MongoDB reads  \n",
    "- ERA5/Open-Meteo API downloads  \n",
    "- Snow drift computations  \n",
    "- SARIMAX model fitting  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also applied `@st.cache_data` to data-loading functions to avoid unnecessary recomputation. This drastically reduced waiting times when navigating between pages or reusing the same parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Error handling (Robust UI Feedback)**\n",
    "Throughout the Streamlit pages, I implemented structured error handling using `try/except` blocks.  \n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "- Missing or misconfigured MongoDB connections  \n",
    "- Missing GeoJSON or Gold-layer CSVs  \n",
    "- ERA5 API failures  \n",
    "- Empty or misaligned datasets after filtering  \n",
    "- Invalid exogenous-variable combinations during SARIMAX forecasting  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of crashing, the app gives clear feedback using `st.error()` or `st.warning()`, helping the user diagnose issues quickly.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Snow Drift Bonus – Monthly Qt**\n",
    "In addition to the mandatory yearly snow-drift calculation (July–June seasons), I implemented:\n",
    "- **Monthly Qt computation** within each season  \n",
    "- A **grouped bar chart** of monthly drift values by season  \n",
    "- An expandable table containing monthly Qt with metadata  \n",
    "- Integration alongside the yearly Qt analysis and wind rose  \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a finer-grained view of snow-drift dynamics and allows comparison of seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Forecasting Bonus – Exogenous Weather Variables in SARIMAX**\n",
    "To extend the forecasting module, I added support for **meteorological exogenous features**, including:  \n",
    "- Temperature  \n",
    "- Precipitation  \n",
    "- Windspeed  \n",
    "- Wind gusts  \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation includes:\n",
    "- Downloading ERA5 weather for the selected training period  \n",
    "- Aligning and cleaning weather data to match hourly/daily aggregation  \n",
    "- Handling ERA5 archive limits by repeating the final observed exogenous values into the forecast horizon  \n",
    "- Automatic dropping of incomplete rows to avoid NaN errors  \n",
    "- Clear warnings to inform the user when the effective forecast horizon is adjusted  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the SARIMAX model to incorporate weather-driven dynamics and satisfies the bonus requirement for forecasting improvements.\n",
